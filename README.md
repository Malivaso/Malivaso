# Information
Just someone trying to make a mod for Gorilla Tag, that's all.
..except I know nothing about C++ sooooo

# Notice
I am no longer working on MonkeColors, as those that distributed Tag Gun have caused Quest Modding to shut down.

# Fuck you to everyone that distributed Tag Gun. You've ruined modding, and are a complete disappointment to the modding community.
### Reasons why Tag Gun users suck at Gorilla Tag:
- Have to use cheats in a game of TAG.
- Ruin everything for everyone they meet
- Annoy the living hell out of people
- Caused the Quest Modding community to shut down.
- Are mostly composed of 9-10 year olds.
