# Information
Just someone trying to make a mod for Gorilla Tag, that's all.
..except I know nothing about C++ sooooo

# Notice
I am no longer working on MonkeColors, as those that distributed Tag Gun have caused Quest Modding to shut down. This is the largest "fuck you" I have ever given to **anyone.**

# Fuck you to everyone that distributed Tag Gun. You've ruined modding, and are a complete disappointment to the modding community.
